# VM-Network-Architecture

This project simulates a small business network environment using VirtualBox, pfSense, and multiple VLANs to isolate infrastructure, client, and server systems.

---

## Project Summary
 - Platform: VirtualBox
 - Tools: pfSense CE acting as the virtual firewall/router
 - Objective: Segment networks using VLAN like isolation to simulate departmental boundaries, enforce inter-VLAN access policies, and demonstrate secure architecture.

## Network Overview

### pfSense WAN (Untagged)
| VLAN | Subnet           | Purpose             |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| 0    | 192.168.1.0/24   | Internal Network Firewall |

### VLANs (LAN Side)
| VLAN | Subnet           | Purpose             |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 192.168.10.0/24  | Infrastructure + DC |
| 2    | 192.168.20.0/24  | Clients (Sales)       |
| 3    | 192.168.30.0/24  | Clients (HR) |
| 4    | 192.168.40.0/24  | File Server (HR) |

> Each VLAN is simulated via separate VirtualBox internal networks due to lack of 802.1Q tagging support.
> pfSense acts as the default gateway and control point for all traffic between VLANs and to the internet.
> DHCP is provisioned per VLAN segment to ensure network autonomy and proper IP assignment.

### VirtualBox Adapter Configuration (pfSense VM):
| Adapter | Network Mode  | VB Network Name  | Simulated VLAN | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| 1    | NAT  | --- | WAN | Internet access (host)
| 2    | Internal  | LabNet_Trunk  | Management | pfSense Web UI |
| 3    | Internal  | LabNet_VLAN10 | VLAN10 | Infrastructure (DC01) |
| 4    | Internal  | LabNet_VLAN20 | VLAN20 | Sales Client |

> **Note:** VLAN 30 and 40 are demonstrated by reassigning Adapter 3/4 to `LabNet_VLAN30` and `LabNet_VLAN40` as needed. This simulates dynamic VLAN testing within VirtualBox's 4-adapter limit.

## Security Design Principles

### Network Segmentation & Lease Privilege
 - Each department is isolated into is own VLAN to minimize lateral movement risk.
 - Inter-VLAN communication is restricted explicitly based on business needs.
### Explicit Firewall Policies
 - No "allow all" rules (except temporary testing allowances). Each service port is explicitly defined.
> VLAN20_SALES only allows TCP 53, 135, 389, 445, etc., to the Domain Controller in VLAN10_INFRA.
### Zero Trust Emulation
 - VLAN boundaries act as security zones.
 - Trust is not assumed; even internal flows are controlled based on roles/policies.
### Defense in Depth
 - All VLANs are firewall isolated.
 - Services such as DNS, NTP, AD DS run only on the INFRA VLAN reducing attack surface.

## Traffic Flow & Firewall Intent

### Centralized Inspection
 - pfSense enforces all inter-VLAN communication and routes external traffic via NAT.
### Role-Based Access  
  - Clients in VLAN20 (Sales) can only reach DC01 in VLAN10 on explicitly permitted ports (e.g. DNS, LDAP, Kerberos, RPC, SMB, NTP).  
  - Clients in VLAN30 (HR) are similarly restricted and can access the File Server in VLAN40 on SMB/HTTPS only.
### Layered Isolation  
  - Traffic between Sales and File Server is blocked entirely â€” no lateral movement.  
  - Administrative VLAN (VLAN10) has widest access only for essential services.
### Fail-Safe Defaults  
  - Any traffic not explicitly permitted (by source, destination, service) is blocked by default.  
  - Temporary broad rules are used only for troubleshooting and are promptly removed once operational.
